# Web3ssh-Hackathon-2025

## Project Tagline
### A unified, tamper-proof, and decentralized platform for verifying real-world skill and participation in Web3 workshops, hackathons, and online micro-courses.

## Step 1: System Design Documentation
In this phase, we defined the problem, solution architecture, and core functional flow of our Web3 project ‚Äî PoSC (Proof of Skill via Contribution).

üîç What We Did:
Identified the real-world problem: lack of verifiable, trusted skill proof from hackathons and workshops.

Wrote a problem statement with a relatable user story (Priya‚Äôs Journey).

Defined clear user roles ‚Äî Participant, Organizer, Verifier.

Mapped out functional requirements for the MVP.

Designed the Soulbound NFT schema for contribution-based skill badges.

Outlined the tech stack: Solidity, IPFS, Hardhat, React, Tailwind, Ethers.js, and Polygon.

Created a journey map to show how a participant goes from joining to receiving a verified badge.

Organized everything inside the /docs folder, fully versioned and pushed to GitHub.

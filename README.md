# Web3ssh-Hackathon-2025
## Title:
### Proof of Skill & Contribution (PoSC): A Web3 Protocol for Verifying Real Participation in Hackathons & Workshops**
## Project Tagline
### A unified, tamper-proof, and decentralized platform for verifying real-world skill and participation in Web3 workshops, hackathons, and online micro-courses.
## **THE CORE PROBLEM:**

> In the current Web2/Web3 ecosystem, there's no reliable, tamper-proof, and decentralized way to verify what someone actually contributed during events like hackathons, workshops, or community projects.
> 

Certificates, PDFs, or POAPs can say *"you were there."*

But **none of them prove:**

- What **you built**
- What **role** you played
- Whether you **actually participated** or just **sat around**

**For builders, recruiters, DAOs, and grant platforms â€” this is a trust black hole.**

## **SOLUTION:**

> Build a Web3-native protocol that lets event organizers and peers issue verifiable, tamper-proof skill attestations as soulbound NFTs, linked to:
> 
- **GitHub commits**
- **On-chain attestations**
- **Peer signatures (wallet-based)**
- **Role-based metadata** like "frontend", "backend", "designer", "mentor", etc.

All of this forms a **real-time, trustless, decentralized skill profile** that evolves with every event.

### KEY DIFFERENTIATORS (Compared to Other Projects):

| Existing System | Weakness | Your Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POAP | Just shows attendance | We verify actual work + role |
| LearnCard / Open Badges | Generic academic focus | We are **event-specific + GitHub verified + decentralized** |
| Gitcoin Passport | Identity proof only | We are **contribution & skill proof** |
| Kleros Badges | General-purpose + slow arbitration | Ours is **event-native + real-time** |

## MAIN TECH STACK â€” 

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ðŸ”¸ Smart Contract | **Solidity + Hardhat** | Mint soulbound badges, verify roles |
| ðŸ”¸ Blockchain | **Polygon Mumbai** | EVM-compatible, fast + cheap |
| ðŸ”¸ Wallet + UI | **React + Tailwind + Ethers.js** | User dashboard, mint, verify |
| ðŸ”¸ Off-Chain Logic | **Node.js + GitHub API** | Validate repo commits, authorship |
| ðŸ”¸ Storage | **IPFS + NFT.Storage** | Store metadata, snapshots, proof assets |
| ðŸ”¸ Signature Verification | **EIP-712** | Organizer & peer role validation |
| ðŸ”¸ Optional Privacy (Phase 2) | **zk-SNARKS / Semaphore** | Selective proof disclosure |
| ðŸ”¸ Deployment | **Vercel** | One-click deploy frontend |

## Step 1: System Design Documentation
In this phase, we defined the problem, solution architecture, and core functional flow of our Web3 project â€” PoSC (Proof of Skill via Contribution).

What We Did:
Identified the real-world problem: lack of verifiable, trusted skill proof from hackathons and workshops.

Wrote a problem statement with a relatable user story (Priyaâ€™s Journey).

Defined clear user roles â€” Participant, Organizer, Verifier.

Mapped out functional requirements for the MVP.

Designed the Soulbound NFT schema for contribution-based skill badges.

Outlined the tech stack: Solidity, IPFS, Hardhat, React, Tailwind, Ethers.js, and Polygon.

Created a journey map to show how a participant goes from joining to receiving a verified badge.

Organized everything inside the /docs folder, fully versioned and pushed to GitHub.

## Docs Included:

## Step 2: Smart Contract Setup â€“ Status Update (Professional Summary for README)

Step 2: Smart Contract Setup Using Hardhat
In this step, we established the complete smart contract development environment to build the PoSCBadge NFT contract â€” which represents verifiable, role-based skill contributions in hackathons and workshops.

### What We Did:
Initialized Hardhat for local Ethereum development.

Installed OpenZeppelin libraries to build secure and standardized NFT (ERC721) contracts.

Created the core contract PoSCBadge.sol to mint skill-based NFTs.

Configured hardhat.config.js with:

Polygon Mumbai testnet for deployment

Environment variables for wallet key and RPC provider

Compiled the smart contract successfully and ensured itâ€™s ready for deployment.

### Deployment Status: Pending
The smart contract has not yet been deployed to the Mumbai testnet due to insufficient MATIC balance in the connected wallet (used for paying gas fees).

## Next Steps
Request test MATIC from Polygon Mumbai Faucet.

Once funds are available, execute deployment using the configured script.

## Note
All smart contract files, configurations, and the deployment script have been successfully pushed to GitHub. Deployment will be completed once testnet funds are available.

# Problem Statement

## The Core Problem
In today’s learning ecosystem, individuals frequently participate in hackathons, workshops, and micro-learning events to gain hands-on experience and practical skills. However, proving real **contribution** and **skill acquisition** from these events is a mess.

- Certificates are easily faked.
- Attendance proofs (like PDFs or POAPs) don’t show what the person actually did.
- Recruiters and DAOs can’t easily verify whether someone contributed or just showed up.

There is **no universal, verifiable, and tamper-proof method** for proving skills gained from informal, real-world learning.

## Short Story (Priya’s Case)
Meet Priya — a student passionate about Web3. She participates in a Solidity workshop, a blockchain hackathon, and builds a small DeFi app. She lists these on her resume with screenshots and certificates.

But when recruiters check:
- One certificate is just a PDF anyone could’ve downloaded.
- Another is a POAP token, showing she attended but not what she did.
- Her GitHub repo isn’t linked to any verified credential.

Despite real effort, Priya **fails to stand out** because there’s **no trusted way to verify her contribution**.

## The Need
There’s an urgent need for a system that:
- Allows event organizers to issue **soulbound badges** based on verifiable contributions.
- Stores proofs (like GitHub activity, skills used, roles performed) on-chain.
- Empowers learners to **own** their skill profile and present it publicly — verifiable by anyone.
